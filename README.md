Rocket League BotChat gives Rocket League bots that ability to chat based on in-game events. This is a BakkesMod plugin that can be installed via the [BakkesPlugins website](https://bakkesplugins.com/).

It is designed to be used with a large language model running locally on your PC. You can set this up using NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM library. The plugin requires an OpenAI-compatible API server running on `localhost:5001`. Please see this repository for details on how to set up a TensorRT-LLM-powered large language model on Windows: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows](https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows).

This project was developed for NVIDIA's [Gen AI on RTX PCs Developer Contest](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/rtx-developer-contest/).
