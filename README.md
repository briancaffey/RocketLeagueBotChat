# Rocket League BotChat

![Rocket League BotChat](/img/cover.png)

## Introduction

Rocket League BotChat gives Rocket League bots that ability to chat based on in-game events. This is a BakkesMod plugin that can be installed via the [BakkesPlugins website](https://bakkesplugins.com/).

It is designed to be used with a large language model running locally on your PC. You can set this up using NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM library. The plugin requires an OpenAI-compatible API server running on `localhost:5001`.

## Setting up a local LLM powered by TensorRT-LLM

Before installing the plugin, you will need to set up a local inference server. Please see this repository for details on how to set up a TensorRT-LLM-powered large language model on Windows: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows](https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows).

Make sure that the server runs on `localhost:5001` (use `--port 5001` when starting the server).
